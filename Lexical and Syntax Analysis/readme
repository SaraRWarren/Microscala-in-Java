Extend your recursive-descent syntax analyzer for MicroScala to produce an abstract syntax-tree
representation of the input program. If the source program has no syntax errors, the result of the
parse should be a source program listing (e.g., this can be printed by the lexical analyzer as the
program is read) and an abstract syntax tree representation of the major program units (e.g., each
main program and method will have a syntax tree). For convenience this syntax tree may be output
at the point at which it is generated (i.e., interleaved with the source program listing). Print the
tree in Cambridge Polish prefix notation.
